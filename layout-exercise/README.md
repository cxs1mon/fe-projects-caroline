# Task 1: Style the Header with Flexbox

Use Flexbox to style the header and its navigation links. Center the navigation menu both horizontally and vertically within the header.

## Steps:

1. Make the .header a flex container and use justify-content and align-items to center the nav menu.
2. Style the ul inside the .nav to display the links in a row.
3. Add padding and background color to the header.

# Task 2: Create a Multi-Column Layout with Floats

Use floats to create a multi-column layout for the articles in the main content area.

## Steps:

1. Make each .article float to the left with a specified width (e.g., 30%) and margin to create space between them.
2. Ensure the float is cleared after the articles by using the clearfix method.
3. Style the articles with padding, background color, and a border for distinction.

# Task 3: Style the Footer with CSS Grid and Apply z-index to Sidebar

Use CSS Grid to create a responsive two-column footer.
Position the sidebar using fixed positioning, and apply a higher z-index to ensure it overlaps the content when scrolling.

## Steps:

1. Define the footer as a grid container with two columns.
2. Style the .footer-left and .footer-right with padding and distinct background colors.
3. Apply fixed positioning to .sidebar and use z-index to stack it above the main content.
